<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Prabhat Ranjan, and I am a final year student at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. <br><br>

I maintain a list of my research projects and implementations under the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="https://prabhat496.github.io/myblog/">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">about me</a>.</p>

I"„<p>I was cursed six years ago. Cursed by fate and the curse was later reinforced by luck. I was cursed with indiscipline and procrastination and the aversion to work.
When I look back, I could see myself working hard at around class 8. That time I was this one confident being with the weapon of hard work in hand, armed to take on the world. I didnâ€™t dream big and mostly kept in what I thought was his lane, driving always.
But then school happened, and then degradation came along. Canine became bovine. It was OK to merely pass since the ultimate aim was to have a good score in boards and competitive exams. I started bunking classes and missing test. The worst part was I started forgetting about the tests, which shows how unconcerned I was. But somehow people kept appreciating me, making me feel more than what I was. People, teachers, tutors have singled me out in the room and said you have great potential - I could remember at least three teachers saying that. It was a big mistake - I started to bunk severely, till the point where I was afraid to back and face the teacher with an attendance sheet. And evidently, I flunked my entrance tests. But I did somehow got a decent score in boards - again luck. I repeated for engineering and still luck - cleared JEE and NEET and AIIMS - that opened the flood gates of appreciation. The fake character built during that time stayed till this date.</p>

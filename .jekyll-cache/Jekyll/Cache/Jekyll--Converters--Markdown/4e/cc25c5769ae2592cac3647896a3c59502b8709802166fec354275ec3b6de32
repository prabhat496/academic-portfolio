		<b>Project Solarise</b>: The project involves designing construction and shipment of a full  furnished two storey building with a non-positive energy consumption. The project tackles the issue of mass housing with the idea of modularity and repeatability in design to exploit economy of scales. This Project was showcased at Solar Decathlon China in 2018 (SDC18) where it won the Best participation award.

		<b>Project LEAF</b>:  Project LEAF is the third project by Team Shunya after Project H naught (2014) &amp; Project Solarise (2018). This project focuses on the vertical growth of Tier-2 cities with a flat topography. This project involves building a sustainable, net-energy +ve rettrofittable house design to be
mounted over existing structure, saving the valuable land resource, while reducing the energy intensity of overall struction. The projct conceptualised a deplyoable design, to be deployed at the site quickly saving valuable construction time. This project was pitched for Solar Decathlon Europe 2021 (SDE21).

		<b>Study of Watershed development in India : The Government perspective</b>: The project involves designing, modelling and building a small scale solar crop dryer with integrated PCM to extend the drying time and reduce the drying stress due to changing environmental factors. The thesis is staged to completion in May 2020. Currently it is in Stage 1. Stage zero report and presentation could be found below.

		<b>RC controlled bot for cleaning suspended macro-particles from stagnant Water Bodies : Innovation Lab</b>: This Project was done as a part of Innovation Lab Project. Our team conceptualise, designed and build a prototype of boat to capture suspended particle from the stagnant water bodies in order to achieve a clean surface. The project was exhibited at the open house organised by Department of Energy Science and Engineering.

<b>Forecasting India's Baseload</b>: The project involves the forecasting of nature of baseload in 2047 (100 years after Independence) given the current trend in renewables and dwindling fossil resourse, especially coal which is currently used for majority of power production in India.

<li>
<b>Study of WECC Load Flow Model</b>: The project involves study of WECC composite bulk load flow modelling and simulation of a grid connection with renewable sources such as wind turbine and Solar PV. The simulation was done in DigSilent Power factory, with varying parameters to observe the dynamic behaviour of power system.

<b>Study of Marine Plastic pollutions</b>: The project involves extensive literature survey of plastic pollution in marine ecology. The problems were identified with different kinds of plastic and their effects in both marine and human life. Various possible solutions and policy interventions were presented along with current innovation in the field.

<b>Mathematical Modelling of Evolution of Eukaryotes</b>: The projet deals with answering the problem of sudden evoluton of eukaryotes. The project attems to model the popular hypothesis of endosymbiosis - the hydrogen hypothesis to estimate the time required for complete ingulfment of archea by a larger bacteria. The archea later takes the role of mitochondria and cell breaks the energy barries to use more energy per gene and hence develop complex mechanism than prokaryotes.
